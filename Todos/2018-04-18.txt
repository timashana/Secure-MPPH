- Turns out that there is no Block-Mean Hash implemented in the src/pHash.cpp file. There's only the prototype in the src/pHash.h file. so the todo's from 2018-04-13 have changed:


#DAVID
1. set up development environment and GitHub
- write documentation on liking external libraries using g++
- write documentation on using external headers in code
- write a main.cpp to test using the libraries.

2. Test whethere or not the mean block hash implementation from the README page works with a test application.

#BON & ANA
1. Continue work on implementing the block mean hash write steps d and e of the of the [phash.org](http://phash.org) masters thesis using c++  in the circuit-format stipulated by libscapi documentation
