The Yao protocol has been implemented ... this is a good library to use called SCAPI
https://github.com/cryptobiu/libscapi

What we could do to start, is to use a simple perceptual hash (any of the ones we have seen so far) and use that. The biggest challenge will be to write the code in the form of a Boolean Circuit. 

Can you guys start looking at the SCAPI code and start familiarizing yourself with it?

Thanks
